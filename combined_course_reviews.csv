1,"Prof Li is a great lecturer, super considerate of his students, and overall very kind. His exams were quite fair despite the difficulty of the content. Highly recommend him for COMP 551!",5,3,3,Comp 551
2,It's hard to explain complex things in simple words and this Prof knows how to do it. Highly recommended!,3,-1,4,Comp 551
3,"tbh those giving him bad ratings in for comp 551 are just mad they didn't do well in this class. Its a 4 credit 500-level class, of course its not easy and a lot of work. His lectures are great. He has really nice slides and he is always available. Overall, great teacher. Just a really hard class.",4,-1,3,Comp 551
4,"machine learning comp551 is a very useful course but also very difficult , but he explained the concept very well . the midterm was a bit tough.",4,3,3,Comp 551
5,"Was always well prepared for lectures and did a comprehensive job at preparing the learning materials and organizing the class. Really made an effort to make the theory as well as the implementations approachable. This course was math heavy, but the professor made sure to go through all of it step by step. The recorded lectures were very helpful.",4,-1,3,Comp 551
6,I really enjoyed taking COMP551 with Professor Li! He is a great instructor and his explanations are clear. The assessments (exams and assignments) were fair. Highly recommend!,4,2,3,Comp 551
7,"Sorry but these other reviewers of COMP551 are already gifted. This course is extremely math and theory focused. Huge derivations were given in lectures as form of ""explanation"". Yes, the assignment extensions were great but for each assignment, only 2 TAs are grading and all other TAs can't help you. Final exam was fair though. Caution, math heavy",-1,2,2,Comp 551
8,"Professor Li is very caring for his students, and his exams are fair and reasonable to complete. He always listens to his students and keeps improving himself! Thank you Professor Li for a great semester!",4,-1,3,Comp 551
9,"Caring professor. The fair midterm (20% open-book), weekly 1% quizzes, and research-type assignments (40%) allow you to show up on the final (also open-book) knowing you already passed the class. He lets students ask questions in lectures and often goes back on previous material as a reminder. Part of the assignments are graded based on creativity.",3,-1,3,Comp 551
10,"Absolutely agree that he's a great professor. The assignment extensions are god-like, lecture slides were informative and organized. He pause at good timing to answer questions. I wish every professor was like him, it would make university a lot easier!",5,-1,3,Comp 551
11,"Great, great prof. His lectures were very well organized and thorough, and he always went out of his way to ensure we understand the content. The assignments were very well made and very useful. He's also incredibly accommodating in terms of deadlines. I can only recommend him!",5,-1,3,Comp 551
12,"You have quizzes and 3 or 4 projects. You can do the quizzes several times. All of the projects with Python and implement them from scratch. It is necessary to study the recorded videos of the class several times. The professor will post sample questions, check them, and quizzes because the main exam is similar to the same questions.",-1,3,3,Comp 551
13,"Curriculum is well thought through, slides are high quality, and online resources are abundant. Group projects were required, which can be annoying, but the assignments themselves were very interesting and enjoyable.",-1,3,2,Comp 551
14,Does not explain the lecture clear enough. A lot of typo in the slides.,2,-1,1,Comp 551
15,"Definitely take COMP 551 with her! The lectures dig into some of the math behind ML. She is also very available outside of class, which is great since this course touches upon many (demanding) topics.",3,-1,3,Comp 551
16,I have never met this kind of irrational professor who gave us a lengthy midterm.,1,-1,1,Comp 551
17,"Her lectures goes very deep with respect to underlying math. Kinda gives you great background in ML and how to read reach papers. The projects were to implement ML algorithms from scratch which solidifies your mathematical understanding with Coding component. Quizzes were challenging, overall, She is one of the best professor to take a course with!",4,3,3,Comp 551
18,Very heavy course with a lot of quizzes. Material was fairly tricky but she did a reasonable job at trying to explain it. Assignments were interesting and not marked too harshly.,2,2,3,Comp 551
19,"The positive reviews are inexplicable. Do not expect to learn anything in this course. His slides are dense, unexplained math formulas with non-standard variable names. The final was 24 multiple choice questions with answers being slight changes to definitions provided a single time on a single slide. Final review sheet had 3 unanswerable questions",1,1,1,Comp 551
20,"He is the least enthusiastic, tired professor I've had. He doesn't explain anything and talks in volume 1/10. He really doesn't care. The classes don't do anything. You are really on your own. Read the textbook and the slides and hope for the best. That's it.",1,0,0,Comp 551
21,Worst course I have ever taken. She obviously has no time nor care to teach. Easy A as she doesn't care to deal with unhappy students.,1,1,1,Comp 579
22,"hello and welcome to Doina Precup as a prof LOL. She may be a titan in her field but she’s an irresponsible and neglectful teacher. Not trying to be harsh it is fact based on a bunch of stuff. I could go on but….all I’ll say is don’t rely on her.Just have some understanding for the poor TAs because I guarantee they are running the course more than Precup, and trying their best when the prof isn’t doing what she’s supposed to. (And no I’m not a TA so it’s not that bias)",1,2,1,Comp 579
23,Worst course I have ever taken. She obviously has no time nor care to teach. Easy A as she doesn't care to deal with unhappy students,0,0,1,Comp 579
24,"I took COMP 206 with Vybihal last year and did not like him as a prof. However, he seemed to have more energy/engagement with the class when teaching 273. I grew to like him a lot, as he is genuinely very nice and accommodating. On the other hand, his lectures are very disorganized and slow. I found all his assessments quite simple though",3,2,2,Comp 273
25,"Clarifications. Clarifications. Clarifications. Every assignment and exam has corrections, clarifications, and apologies, because it's never clear what he wants from you. Also not an engaging lecturer, though he does have a good grasp of the material, and if you can stand him then you stand to learn a lot from him.",1,2,2,Comp 273
26,"As a person, he's really nice and genuinely tries to make students understand but unfortunately the guy doesn't know how to teach. Incredibly boring lectures, with 30mins spent on explaining a simple concept that you'll still have to self educate on and makes tough assignments and midterms while expecting us to know stuff which he never taught.",2,1,2,Comp 273
27,"By far the worse instructor I've ever encountered at McGill. Only class where I had to attend lectures, re-watch all the lecture recordings twice, do all tutorials and still do poorly. Vibihal slides are mostly incomplete, full of mistakes, assg' s and tests are poorly worded and confusing. Very few useful examples. Avoid at all costs.",0,1,1,Comp 273
28,"The content was extremely interesting but unfortunately the professor's vagueness made it almost a pain. Exam questions were poorly worded and relevant assignments were only graded post-exams, so you couldn't use them to study. I think that this could be a fantastic course if the questions on assignments and exams were just a bit clearer. .",2,3,2,Comp 273
29,"Genuinely such a good prof. 273 is a hard class and MIPS is obviously wack, but he makes it pretty fun.",4,3,4,Comp 273
30,"I'm in between a 2 and a 3. Assignments are absurdly long, but are also long-term beneficial. If only he clarified the suspect PDFs in a timely manner. For 273, he curves the average up to B+ (minimum), so can't complain much. Average lecturer, uninspiring and a bit disorganized but adequate. Nice in lectures and office hours, condescending online.",3,2,2,Comp 273
31,"His assignments are super tough but to be fair to him, he is pretty accessible and presents the material in a clear and concise way, even though it is clear that this course has nothing to do with what he researches or what interests him, he still tries to be engaging by always encouraging students to ask questions during lectures. (soothing voice)",4,3,4,Comp 273
32,"I'm in my last year and have taken a number of higher level COMP courses and this course was still without a doubt the most heavy in work load. Assignments are completely unfair, riddled with errors that they don't bother correcting until days before the assignment is due. The class on average spends 40 hours on each assignment worth 5-7.5 percent.",1,1,1,Comp 273
33,"Kaleem really cares about whether his students understand or not, and he always tried to be available to help and answer questions. The course material was not overly difficult but the assignments took SO LONG (idk if other profs for COMP273 are better with this though). Exam was easier than expected. But yeah, the assignments were the worst.",4,3,3,Comp 273
34,"Very clear and well made lectures, adapted very well to online learning. Definitely a content heavy class but I learned a lot and never felt overwhelmed.",-1,4,3,Comp 273
35,"Terrible teacher, has no empathy for his students, clearly only has this Job so he can continue doing research at mcgill.",0,-1,0,Comp 273
36,"His teaching ability is good, but his 3rd homework absolutely destroyed me. He claims to care about your learning, but makes you work so hard that you can't focus on your other classes well. He's part of those who think ""harder is always better"", but forget that you have other stuff to do too. As a result, my semester learning experience was poor.",2,2,2,Comp 273
37,"Ridiculus is the only suitable word. He doesn't allow final to replace midterm, gave us a practice midterm containing MCs but made us write mips code on paper in midterm. Makeup policy is extremely unfair, after our complains about the midterm on Ed, other students know what to expect on makeup midterm. And his assignments take forever to do!",1,-1,1,Comp 273
38,"Lectures pretty fast paced, assignments long and time-consuming, but grading is alright. comp273 is suck, but his lectures make it less boring",3,1,2,Comp 273
39,"Not the best professor in terms of teaching, but okayish. Nice person",2,-1,2,Comp 273
40,"The course material was pretty difficult but he explained well and often stopped the lecture to provide examples which I found to be helpful. You absolutely do not need to go to class, I pretty much watched the recordings for the entire semester. The assignments were cool and not too hard and if you do well then you can do well easily.",4,3,3,Comp 273
41,"This professor's classes are incredibly easy to understand, and the professor is very accessible outside of class (I posted a question on Ed on a Sunday and he replied within the hour).",4,-1,3,Comp 273
42,"Honestly, I didn't find his lectures very clear. He goes through the slides as if someone else wrote them and he doesn't know what's going to come next. His explanations aren't very organized. Fair evaluations though.",1,-1,1,Comp 273
43,"His voice is SO SOOTHING!!! I absolute hate comp273, more than anything. But the only thing that I took from it is that Paul Kry is an awesome professor and I wish I was more interested in the material to really appreciate him. Lovely lovely prof who always want to help you succeed",4,1,3,Comp 273
44,"Has the voice of a voice actor. Passionate about the topics, I enjoyed his inverted classrooms and the coding practices. Assignments are reasonable, tests are multiple choices and fairly easy (compared to other classes)",4,4,4,Comp 273
45,"The lecture is clear. The assignments are long and time consuming. The exams focus on the contents taught in the lectures, so attending classes or going through all the recordings are recommended. Overall nice professor with clear lectures.",4,3,3,Comp 310
46,"I heard a lot of bad things about this class before taking it. But i ended up enjoying it very much. This class does require tons of work, but prof explains the material clearly! Learned a lot by taking this class. Just make sure you have enough time to focus on reviewing for the exams and doing assignments.",3,2,3,Comp 310
47,"The lectures do not prepare you for the assignments. Assignments require high comfort level of C, which is not taught. The slides have countless typos, are generally confusing, and are just not enough to answer certain exam questions.",1,0,1,Comp 310
48,"Assignments are really heavy and take a long time. Lectures are a bit boring but I think he realized the weight of the tasks and made 1 assignment and 1 midterm optional(this helped a lot). Note: I think the exams were heavy on memorizing everything, not that much creative application.",2,1,2,Comp 310
49,Lectures are quite useless for the exams and assignments. This class has some important and interesting material but I did not enjoy this class at all.,1,1,1,Comp 310

52,"Do not take this course unless you have a strong background in C and are willing to spend dozens of hours debugging your assignment with little to no guidance. The course covers a lot of interesting topics, but the lectures are only meant to explain these topics conceptually. Exams are unreasonably difficult and assignments are unreasonably long.",1,1,1,Comp 310
53,Learned a lot. Never showed up to class because it was online and recorded. The three midterms were the only reason I stayed caught up to date on lectures. Had a couple hard questions on midterms but he curved to account for it. Assignments take a lot of work but taught me lots of useful C skills.,2,3,2,Comp 310
54,"He gives too much work, too many exams, the exams are too hard. He doesn't realize how much work he really gives.",1,0,1,Comp 310

My only suggestion is DO NOT TAKE ANY COURSE WITH THIS PROF",0,0,0,Comp 310
56,"Hard and long assignments, easy exams. I've taken 310 and 202 with him. His assignments are hard and take a while, but he is such an incredible teacher that it makes up for it. He is always so accessible outside of class, even with the TA strike and big class, he answered questions within hours. Love him, when I see his name I take the class.",4,3,3,Comp 310
57,"A absolute gem of a prof. I went in blind, not knowing what to expect, having never had him, and I came out truly inspired by the work and effort he put in the class. He is truly one of the greatest prof I've had and sadly the word limit on the review prevent me from describing all his iconic moments. but trust if u have the chance to have him, do",4,-1,3,comp 310
58,Great professor! Really cares about his students and wants to make the class the best possible experience for everyone taking it,4,-1,3,Comp 310
59,Easily one of the best CS prof I have in McGill. His assignment might be too hard for 200 level but for a 300 level course he is amazing. The most caring prof I ever seen (answer question in 2am),4,-1,3,Comp 310
60,"This professor cares about the subject and his priority is his students' learning. He is very active and does everything in his power to make the course fun and interesting! I only took this course because I saw it was taught by Jonathan and have no regrets. Would recommend taking any courses he teaches, and recommend participating in the course!",4,-1,4,Comp 310
61,"If you can, take whatever course this man is teaching. An absolute gem of a professor and I feel extremely lucky to have been taught by him in two separate courses during my undergraduate degree. You don't notice just how much a good professor influences a class until you have one as great as JCC.",4,-1,3,Comp 310

65,His unconventional teaching style is a breath of fresh air at McGill. I don't think I have ever seen someone put this much effort into teaching a course. Assignments are very long and challenging but if you do them well its not hard to get a good grade in the course.,4,2,3,Comp 310
66,"Prof. Campbell is the reason why I switched into CS. He is extremely invested in his teaching, somehow manages to make lectures and assignments engaging despite the dryness of the subject. This course was challenging, but just like with 202 I feel as though I have learned a lot more from it than any other course",4,2,3,Comp 310
67,Actually the best prof at McGill!! This was my second class with him and he makes learning so fun!,4,-1,3,Comp 310
68,"What is there to say about JCC that hasn't already been shouted from the heavens? JCC is the hardest working, most caring, and downright hilarious profs I've ever had the pleasure of learning from. He will probably never teach COMP310 again, but, god damn, if he ever does, drop everything and take it with this gem of a human.",5,-1,3,Comp 310

70,"Great prof! Midterm and final were much easier than the homework, which we had 6 of. Personally, I loved the first half of the course (DFA's, regexp, pumping lemma, CFL's) but the last half (reductions, computability) was really hard. Everything was very fair and plus lectures are recorded.",4,3,3,Comp 330
71,"Prof Prakash is a very fair prof. He manages to convey his love for automata theory clearly and get us to understand why this subject matters, even if you're not math savvy. Seems quite harsh at first but his attitude helps to get a rigorous sense of thinking about this subject. Respectable and funny and his TAs were perfect.",4,-1,3,Comp 330

73,"Theory of computation is not an easy class, but he makes it very easy. He writes the notes in class which is amazing, and it feels more engaging rather than just going over slides. We did have 6 assignments, a midterm and a final. He told us before hand what to expect from the final and allowed a 10 page crib sheet. An overall great expereince!",4,1,3,Comp 330
74,"Overall, he's a very competent prof. Only problem is that he can be quite rude and judge people in front of everyone for asking bad questions, which is something that is only inevitable given the difficulty of the course content. This consequently made for somewhat of a hostile atmosphere. Overall, COMP 330 was fair with him though.",3,2,2,Comp 330
75,"Professor Prakash is one of the best comp sci professors at McGill, by far. He's a bit sassy, but it only makes it more interesting. His lectures are sometimes hard to follow, and the material isn't easy. But if you put in the time, you'll do fine. The assignments are really hard, but his exams are super fair. I totally recommend it!",4,3,3,Comp 330
76,"He is extremely passionate about education and it shows. He teaches in a way that sparks curiosity which makes you want to learn more on your own or from him in office hours.

82,Cesare is a gem in the cs department. At McGill its very easy to get an instructor who very clearly does not want to teach at all or who is awful at it. He is neither. I personally found the course material very interesting but if you arent interested in it him teaching it makes it a good class to take because many courses are poorly taught.,4,3,3,Comp 330

Assignments are not easy but after going to OH + discussing with other classmates you get many different perspectives, which helps with understanding the content.

225,303 is a very useful class if you're looking to become a developer. The class is interesting and the course load was manageable (took it during covid so take this with a grain of salt). I took it with Guo and it was already 3 years ago though so it might be different.,-1,3,3,Comp 303

227,"You are fine for 303. Robillard's textbook is all you need (it's a small book and explains the concepts really well). Maybe play around with Java during the break if you really want to do well, try refactoring your 250 assignments using new APIs or add abstract classes/interfaces. 302 is a different course entirely, but still useful though. It teaches you a different way of thinking about CS, while 303 is more about writing maintainable code.",-1,3,3,Comp 303
228,"Also got an A in 303. You just need to be constantly on top of it. From the minute an assignment is released till the deadline. You gotta plan, communicate and make sure ppl are on track. Many just didnt have the time or resources to do that.",2,3,3,Comp 303
229,"I would say this course is def worth taking cus it lays the foundation of software engineering. It focuses on the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming, which is quite important if you wanna pursue a career in CS. The prof Jin Guo, however, was below my expectation. Her lectures were deadly boring and her demo was nearly impossible to follow. Only the best kids in class could keep up with her. It's more like if you are super clever and understand the course contents well, you don't need to attend lectures at all; but if you are an average student who didn't know about the concepts at the beginning, you wouldn't be able to understand it following her lectures. I also personally hate the way she framed the course. There were no assignments but 4 lab tests and 2 exams. The course is very practical so I would love more assignment-based or project-based practices. Only by working on a real project/discussing with teammates could I understand the importance and usefulness of design patterns. However, none of them was provided. Studying COMP 303 was no different from studying a dry maths course: exams, exams, and exams. I personally don't think it should be like that. With all being said, she was a really nice and patient person. Many students seem to like her. But still, doing COMP 303 with her wasn't a good experience for me overall",2,2,2,Comp 303
230,"I took COMP303 in Fall 2020 with Jin Guo, and in my experience it's the easiest COMP class I have ever taken.As for drawbacks of this course, I guess the fact that there is no assignment counts as one problem since students get less hands-on experience, but I have to say that having only lab tests and midterm/final as assessment really makes this class much more lightweight. I didn't need to spend hours on assignments. Instead, I just spend two to three hours before each lab test doing the exercises provided and that sufficed. It really saved me time. Also note that professor Jin Guo has a relatively heavy accent and her English grammar is not all that good (though visibility improving), so I guess some students might have a hard time figuring out what she's trying to say. The TAs that evaluate the lab tests are also sometimes not that knowledgeable. I used lambda expressions during one of the lab test and the TA who evaluated me did not know what that is and I had to explain. Overall though it was a good experience.",3,4,4,Comp 303
231,"Guo is so far the best 303 prof you can have imo. I did not expect the material to be easy, but she is always happy to help you succeed. I do agree that this course is poorly designed, but it's not her fault.",4,2,3,Comp 303
232,"Class was aight, the exams weren't particularly difficult or out to get you. Most concepts are taught solely around the Java implementation which makes it not that applicable to other languages -- the ideas around them are pretty important universal though.

Yall could just tell her all the negative stuff to her face and shed probably try to fix it.",4,3,3,Comp 303

235,"This particular course has been a bit hit or (mostly) miss for at least a decade. It's been taught with StandardML, Common Lisp, Scala, OCaml, Java, etc. It's actually been about programming languages and paradigms, and it's been a very long introduction to type theory with a smattering of functional programming. Since the course changes frequently and has been hijacked a couple of times, it isn't as polished as some others and little effort tends to go into making it an enjoyable course with digestible material. People throw their hands up and say things like ""students are doing badly and hate it because functional programming is just hard to learn!"" I think there's a lot of evidence against this with great examples like ""Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!""

I'm taking comp 302 this semester and as a U3 in software engineering, with some FP experience, I find it pretty easy. I've stopped going to the lectures because they were too slow for me, I instead watch them at 1.5x speed and it's much better.

It's not that hard once you understood what is happening in the code. I hope it helps.,2,3,3,Comp 302

The final seemed (knock on wood) relatively easy compared to what I was expecting, or what they could have given. Definitely fair in terms of length and material covered. My current opinion on comp302 is that they should flip the course around, or integrate the more formal understanding of the language throughout the semester as opposed to at the end.
